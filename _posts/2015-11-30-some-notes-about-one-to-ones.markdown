One-on-one meetings is a very interesting topic and, as always, everyone has an
opinion. I do too and I'm going to share mine, so please don't take this
as a set of rules. It sums up what I've learned about the matter in the last few years.

Two premises to start with:

- I was very skeptical about this kind of meetings at first as I considered it
  a manager's tool. It is not. More about this later.
- I now consider one-on-ones one of the most powerful tools a manager can use to
  help their team.

With those two points in mind, I think there are a lot of questions to
answer about one-on-ones. The frequency, the outcomes, how to plan the meeting.
Before I get to those points, I would like to highlight what I think is the
most important aspect of one-on-ones: this meeting is not for you, the
manager. It is a very powerful tool as long as the people you're having one-on-ones
with use the meeting for their own needs. This is absolutely crucial,
the rest of the discussion makes no sense at all otherwise.

Now the details:

  - How to plan a one-on-one

    I personally don't really plan them. As I said above, I consider them a tool for the
    person "on the other side" of the meeting. So I ask them how they want to use
    the meeting as long as we are on the same page. We consider it a tool to make
    us happier. To clarify doubts, misunderstandings. We talk about things that
    aren't related to work if we feel like.

  - The frequency

    I know some people need reminders to set up one-on-ones. I think this already
    explains very well people miss the point. Once again, these meetings are not for you,
    the manager. You don't get to choose the frequency. My only rule is an upper
    bound: not less than once per month. Now, it can be once per month, once per week,
    every day or whatever. It does not really matter; what does matter is that I am
    not the one who needs the meeting.

  - The outcomes

    This is the most dangerous part. You definitely don't want to use
    the meeting to set up or review expectations. If you feel those things matter
    to you (I don't necessarily think "setting up expectations is required"), set up
    a focused meeting on this matter. The outcome of one-on-ones is a direct consequence
    of the topics you get to discuss during the meeting. It can be very different
    things. It can be something like "let's figure out together how to decrease
    bugs", "please tell me next time I get angry and I don't notice so I can
    improve", "let's work with X on Y because you both can benefit from the
    experience". Again, it can be anything.

Generally, I explain those things I have just explained here during the
first one-on-one I have with people that join my team. And then I take it from
there. If you keep it as free-form as possible, you'll see a very
interesting phenomenon: each person will use the meeting in a different way.
You'll see some themes being developed more than others depending on the
person. If the experience varies a lot, you're doing it right. People are
different, you don't want to treat them all in the same way. You want to be
equally fair with all of them. Some need to focus on tech things,
others on soft skills. And that's the very core of my point. It's their
meeting, let them choose what to do with it.

When I sent the first draft of this article to a friend via email, his first
reaction was: "From what you've jsut described, your idea of one-on-ones looks like
2 people grabbing a coffee and having a chat, which I seriously believe is good! But
how can you not lose the "meetingness"?". That is actually a good point. The
idea you may get here is: I think these meetings should be very informal.
The core point will anyway remain the same: you shouldn't be
driving a single one-on-one. It will be more formal with some people and "exactly like going
for a coffee" for other people. Making it serious and official makes it boring
too, like most meetings. You have to let the other person go where they wants to
go. You'll love the results.
