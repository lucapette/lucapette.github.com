h2. Introduction

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356379/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&tag=lucapette-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399377&creativeASIN=1934356379"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&Format=_SL160_&ASIN=1934356379&MarketPlace=US&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&tag=lucapette-20&ServiceVersion=20070822"
style="display:inline; float:left; margin: 4px 8px 0 0"></a> I have already said it in an another post: "RSpec":http://rspec.info/ is a wonderful framework. It has a great, sexy and simple syntax. For these reasons I had to read something about it. I read The RSpec book without even throwing a first glance at the table of contents. My point was: if I like a framework, chances are I will like a book written by its maintainer.

h2. The book

So, as usual, my considerations grouped by chapter:

(#chapters)* _*Introduction*_
The book starts with an introduction to the reasons behind BDD. It's a cool introduction, small and clear. It's very useful if these topics are a closed book for you. To cut a long story short, if you want a spectacular and small introduction to BDD/TDD reasons watch "this":http://vimeo.com/23061155 by "Corey Haines":http://coreyhaines.com/.
* _*Hello*_
The chapter follows the every-good-programming-book-starts-with-a-hello-world rule. The author will give two simple examples: a spec with the class described by the spec itself and a cucumber feature with its step definitions. If you already know this stuff you could skip this chapter.
* _*Describing Features*_
The chapter starts with a brief description of a game that will guide the reader throughout the book. The author explains the rules of the game in a nice way. He describes how to extract stories from a project and write cucumber features and scenarios. If you are new to cucumber you'll find this chapter enlightening.
* _*Automating Features With Cucumber*_
Writing features and scenarios is like writing in less or more plain English. That is nice but it's not strictly related to the quick feedback you need while developing. So the author introduces the step definitions to you and the single parts of a step: given, when and then. A very clear explanation.
* _*Describing Code With RSpec*_
Cucumber is your friend when you are at the application level but, when you need more granularity in your automatic tests, you would like to use RSpec. The chapter presents the anatomy of a spec. The first paragraphs are interesting, the point of view of the author is simple and clear. It explains details without wasting your time. Then it goes on with the red/green technique and you'll read how to describe code behaviour (it's all about behavior! would say a nice "guy":http://dannorth.net/). The chapter finishes with refactoring. BDD gives you confidence with refactoring. That's why I'm in love with it.
* _*Adding New Features*_
When you add a new feature to a project there are chances you will break both your features and your specs. That's just fine, the author will guide you in adding new features in the way you will get all things working and go home.
* _*Specifying An Algorithm*_
This chapter is one of my favourites. It contains a number of important things. First of all, it gives you a piece of advice you should follow: start with the simplest thing and then go on with the next simplest. Following this path you will find nice opportunity of code refactoring without losing your confidence with what you're doing. If you break something, your specs will tell you. In short, rapid feedback is the key to success.
* _*Refactoring With Confidence*_
I've just said that the previous chapter is one of my favourites. Well, maybe this one is even better. You get to know what code smells are. A code smell is "a hint that something has gone wrong somewhere in your code". It's a very enjoyable chapter.
* _*Feeding Back What We've Learned*_
This is a wrapping up chapter that will show you how to experiment with code in order to understand if there is room for improvements.
* _*The Case For BDD*_
The part of the book devoted to BDD as a practice and a technique starts with this chapter. The author will give you a bit of background about BDD, some fundamental reasons behind it. A very readable chapter.
* _*Writing Software That Matters*_
The chapter goes beyond the reasons and gives you a concrete perspective of how to apply BDD to projects.
* _*Code Examples*_
The chapter covers all the basic syntax of RSpec. It is very informative and I think you'll enjoy it.
* _*RSpec::Expectations*_
I really liked this chapter because I of the approach of the author to explaining things. It is detailed and simple. In particular, I enjoyed the paragraph "How It works" related to the have methods.
* _*RSpec::Mocks*_
The chapter explores the world of mocks and stubs. It gives you a complete view of names and options that you have when you need mocks.
* _*Tools And Integration*_
RSpec has a nice executable, you can use it in a terminal. The author will show the numerous options the executable has. Furthermore, he will give you a short description of how to integrate RSpec with Rake, autotest and TextMate.
* _*Extending RSpec*_
RSpec is a polite Ruby citizen. This chapter covers configurations aspects you need to know if you want to change the default behaviour of some parts of RSpec.
* _*Intro To Cucumber*_
The chapter will give you an effective introduction to the crucial aspects of cucumber.
* _*Cucumber Details*_
And this one goes straight to cucumber details. Informative.
* _*BDD In Rails*_
Rails is everyone's framework. This chapter will tell you how to get a good working BDD cycle in Rails. Furthermore, it explains how to set up a Rails project with RSpec.
* _*Cucumber In Rails*_
Like the previous chapter but for cucumber.
* _*Simulating The Browser With Webrat*_
Webrat is a nice DSL that will help you to test an application _simulating the browser_. It makes it possible to test how various layers of a Rails application work together.
* _*Automating The Browser With Webrat And Selenium*_
Webrat helps you to simulate the interaction with your application as if the test were executed by a browser. However, this can't help with pages that have many javascript features. The chapter covers basic aspects of integrating RSpec, Webrat and Selenium.
* _*Rails Views*_
The chapter tries to reply the question "Why do I have to test views in isolations?" and gives nice reasons. It teaches you how to test your reails views and how to mock ActiveRecord Models.
* _*Rails Controllers*_
As the previous one but for controllers.
* _*Rails Models*_
As the previous one but for models.

The book contains three appendixes and the first one is wonderful. You'll read a nice introduction to a really wonderful project: "rubyspec":http://rubyspec.org/. I strongly recommend you to take a look to this project.

h2. What I liked most

This book covers topics I like very much, so it would be strange if I disliked it. *You surely have to read this book* if you care about topics covered. What I really likes most is the care for details. For example, you'll find many things covered with implementation details about the framework. This approach increases the quality of a technical book and I'd like to see this kind of details in other books too.

h2. What I disliked most

Nothing in particular. The book covers many other things apart from RSpec and, ironically, this could be considered a flaw because you would prefer to stay focused on the framework. However, the other topics are quite interesting to read so I don't consider it to be a problem.
