In a previous article about
[deloominator](https://github.com/lucapette/deloominator), I explained why I
choose Go from a product perspective. In this article, I want to share my
experience with Go as a developer.

I've never written about "why I like language X". I don't find the topic
particularly interesting either as a writer or as a reader. But I feel compelled
to make an exception with Go for two reasons:

- I had many "unfinished conversations" on Twitter about the topic, and I
  promised I would find the time to write about it.
- Most of the criticism around Go I run into lacks depth and makes me think
  people have never got past reading a few lines of Go.

Fair warning: I don't have a particular interest in language features in the
context of programming as a craft, so the article won't be about that. I like
theory and I enjoy reading about different languages. But when it comes to
building products, I care about many other aspects:

- Documentation
- Testing experience
- Workflow experience
- Standard library
- Available libraries
- Community

I've often felt out of place among developers discussing programming languages.
My experience is that few developers care about some of these areas and the big
majority care about language features only. Of course I also find language
features relevant, but to me they are only one aspect of a much broader
conversation about the workflow experience.

Before diving into each point, let me quickly recap what `deloominator` does at
the time of writing:

- It lets you query mysql or postgres databases from a web interface.
- It has a detection algorithm for charts. You give it a query and you get a
  chart back. (Detection algorithm sounds fancy, but it's a [trivial piece of
  code](https://github.com/lucapette/deloominator/blob/master/pkg/charts/detect.go#L17).)
- It saves "questions" (a query with its results) into a database for later
  reference.

As the UI of the application is a single-page React application, these features
are exposed via an HTTP server. `deloominator` is still in its early days as a
product, but, while working on it, I've been exposed to the language long enough
to form an opinion on the aspects I consider relevant.

## Documentation

Good documentation is invaluable. Since everyone has their own definition of
"good", here is mine:

- Good docs don't make me search on the web
- Good docs have working examples I can start with
- Good docs follow clear conventions that foster reading habits

Official Go documentation is *really* good. I almost never have to search the
web â€“ the official docs are enough. As I use the superb
[Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) for browsing documentation, I can learn just
with dash and the editor. There is little context switch.

Godoc offers [testable examples](https://blog.golang.org/examples): snippets of
code embedded in the documentation itself. You can run them while reading the
docs and they are part of the automated test suite. Each package in the standard
library has an overview, a table of contents, and an examples section. This
convention created a habit: if I have no idea what the package is about, I start
from the overview. Otherwise, I go straight to the examples section: I look
around, find a good example that works for me, move on to the next problem. In
case you're not familiar with it, here is how testable examples look like:

![go doc](/img/godoc.png)

Being able to run examples right there is helpful, I use the feature when I'm
not sure I understood the docs.

The first steps with a new language are always a bit cumbersome, because I don't
know what is idiomatic and what is not. Before getting into `deloominator`, I
was only toying around with Go. This was my first "big" Go project and
[effective go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) was vital for me at the
time. I'm not sure if the name of the document is inspired by the wonderful
[Effective
Java](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/105099.Effective\_Java\_Programming\_Language_Guide).
Either way, the result is the same: I constantly went back to it as the ultimate
source of inspiration for writing code. If you're relatively new to Go and want
to learn more, "effective Go" is a perfect companion for your journey.

In general, there is a strong documentation culture in the Go community and I
couldn't be happier about it.

## Testing experience

I experience a direct correlation between languages and the kind of testing I
can write. That's why I call it "testing experience"; writing tests is more than
just tooling.

Writing tests is possibly my favorite Go activity because:

- I can go far enough without external libraries

  I'm too old to ignore the maintenance cost, so I'm happy the standard library
  goes a long way. One little feature I miss is the lack of colors in the
  output, but that's a personal nuance.

- I enjoy Go testing idioms

  Go tests tend to make a heavy use of [table driven
  tests](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/TableDrivenTests) and the approach
  fits well with my way of thinking about tests. [Advanced
  tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hQG7QlcLBk) often use golden files
  that help to check complex output. The combination of golden files and table
  driven testing is what I like the most about writing tests with Go. It's easy
  to cover a bug fix or to add another test case for a new feature.

- I have a strong preference for integration tests

  A good explanation of my preference is out of scope of this article. It is
  sufficient to say that my own preference troubles me, because I can't easily
  write reliable and fast integration tests in many languages. `deloominator`
  integration tests are fast and reliable despite doing a lot of things. One
  example is how `deloominator` handles tests for SQL dialects: each test
  creates a new database and a schema using a template, loads some data,
  and finally asserts something. Each of these tests creates its own world;
  there's no sharing and, therefore, they can safely run in parallel (speed!). I
  would have never done it this way in a different language and, in this case,
  it came naturally. Writing tests that achieve my preferred level of isolation
  and integration is easy, fast, reliable.

Because of these factors, I enjoy writing tests in Go more than in any other language I
worked with in the past. The tests I write give me a great deal of confidence
which is a driving factor of the "workflow experience", the aspect I'm
discussing in the next paragraph.

## Workflow experience

The everyday relationship I have with the language, the combination of
tooling and language features is what I call "workflow experience".

Let's start with the tooling: Go provides great basics for everything but
dependencies. While I'm happy to see an amazing team doing amazing work on
[dep](https://github.com/golang/dep), the current status isn't great for such a
recent language. I vendor everything via
[govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor) and it works. But I have to
read docs every time I use it. Now, I'm sure one could say "it's your specific
tool, X is better!" and I wouldn't argue. The point is, though, that my
experience with dependency management is pretty much the same as in any other
language I've come across. As an everyday user, you only need to know how to
download, update, add or remove dependencies, and you're good to go (pun not
intended). I have high hopes for dep to become the one solution that makes Go a
modern language from this perspective too (yes, I'm indeed implying it is not
right now).

Apart from dependency management, the tooling around Go is pretty awesome. The
official toolchain offers a coherent command line experience (coherent is better
than consistent when it comes to interaction, but developers seem to like the
latter more. Sorry, I digress). I'm happy I don't have to bother with styling
(`gofmt` is so good), I like even more that testing is part of the official
toolchain. The Go community builds a lot of useful tooling, so to keep it short,
I will discuss only the ones I use every day for `deloominator`. The first
on the list is [gometalinter](https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter), a
nice tool that runs many linters and normalizes their output. I use it in all my
Go projects because it takes care of the boring parts (like installing the
linters I use) and makes setting up new linters a 1-minute process. Another nice
tool is [go-bindata](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata), a small utility
that generates Go code to embed files from a disk in the output binary. I'm using
it to embed the React application into the binary, it's easy to use.
Unfortunately, it seems completely abandoned right now, so I'm looking for a
replacement. Interesting note: it's been working fine for almost two years after the last
commit. Stability is a priority in the Go world and I appreciate it a lot. Last
but not least, I love how well-integrated the Go tooling in [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is. The editor supports Go officially and the
editing experience is enjoyable. It's worth underlining that most features
are built upon tooling you can use in other editors; most features come from CLI
applications ([gocode](https://github.com/nsf/gocode) or
[gomodifytags](https://github.com/fatih/gomodifytags) are great examples).

Tooling makes for half of the workflow experience, the other half is language features.
When I started using Go, I found a mix of very high-level constructs (like
`select`, `go` and go routines) and low-level ones (like pointers, structs)
confusing. After a while though, I started seeing an interesting development in
my way of thinking about code. I was more relaxed about naming and structural
organization of different parts. Go makes it easy for me to remove things, to
restructure big chucks of code or just to change them. A few factors make a
difference: very few language features make the code always easy to read, a strange
mix of high-level and low-level constructs gives me enough power without too much
responsibility for the underlining system, and the ability of writing very solid
integration tests makes refactoring a confident process. This workflow is the
most relaxed I experienced so far. When discussing Go features, I like to say: I
came to Go for the `go` keywords and channels, I stayed because of interfaces
and a lack of features.

The workflow experience helps to start new projects too. To me, starting a new
project means writing some code so I can understand the problem I'm
trying to solve better. There's a lot of cognitive load, because it's an uncharted
territory: I have to think hard about naming and about dependencies between
parts. The workflow experience with Go makes bootstrapping easier on average.
But there's more: the compiler is super annoying (in a
good way), and I have to check all the errors _before_ I can even run the
program once. The frustration of writing `if err != nil` all over the place is at
the core of one of my favorite features: the distinction between errors and
exceptions. It forces me to think about things I can choose to ignore while
bootstrapping a project in other languages: the file may not be there, the
network connection may fail, and so on. Unfortunately, it is indeed annoying
to write a lot of `if err != nil`, so I guess people often do
not get past the initial impact. And they never experience that "Go
programs are production ready as soon as they compile". Sometimes, that's really
true.

It's hard to talk about Go features without talking about generics.
`deloominator` supports multiple databases, which often made me think about the
argument "we don't need generics". I would find writing different
dialects' code easier to organize if the language had generics, but the more I
think about it, the more I'm convinced it's because of a habit. I ran into the
feeling "oh I really wish Go had generics" often in the past, and the answer
way too often was that my code did not embrace Go interfaces. Now I think there's a
middle ground between "we don't need generics" and "let's do what Java does". I
agree we have not found the answer yet, but I do hope that if we ever get generics,
they will feel like Go interfaces.

## The standard library

The Go standard library is often praised by developers and I can see why. Most
parts are solid, easy to use, and well documented. In no particular order, here
are a few things I enjoy about the standard library:

- [net/http](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/)

   `deloominator` has only a few endpoints and `http` has almost everything I needed so
   far. I only needed [goji](http://goji.io/) for registering endpoints under a
   specific pattern.

- [net/httptest](https://golang.org/pkg/net/httptest/)

   `httptest` provides a response recorder that makes testing HTTP handlers
   easy and fun. It gives me great confidence, because I can assert behavior over
   the actual response output; I do not mock anything.

- [database/sql](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql)

   Despite using a small ORM for the internal storage, I'm satisfied with `sql`.
   It feels low-level compared to any other library I've used (I did mostly Ruby.
   And Ruby has Sequel â€“ an incredible library that deservers its own article).
   Despite the low-level feeling, the package is well-designed and easy to use.

For some reason, working with time and dates has always been a
bit painful in any language I used. Sadly, Go manages to do worse than other
languages, especially when it comes to parsing time and dates. I don't find
the API intuitive. You need to provide a "date layout" instead of a pattern for
parsing dates, something like (copying from the official docs):

```go
// longForm shows by example how the reference time would be represented in
// the desired layout.
const longForm = "Jan 2, 2006 at 3:04pm (MST)"
t, _ := time.Parse(longForm, "Feb 3, 2013 at 7:54pm (PST)")
fmt.Println(t)
```

The package provides some layouts, and if you're lucky enough, the format you
want is there then parsing dates is OK. The experience gets considerably worse
if you need a custom layout. As a result "some random date" ends up in your
code as a constant. I'm not entirely sure what the reason to diverge so much
from the usual "give me a pattern and I'll try to parse this for you" was, but the
experience has not been pleasant so far. If I felt more comfortable with the
official issue tracker (more about this in the "community" paragraph), I would
propose to change the package _a lot_ for the upcoming Go 2.

## Available libraries

Libraries and framework are among the most relevant factors that determine my choice
of a language. I feel "there's a good library for everything" nowadays, as the
community is large enough. One aspect I find interesting is that, despite the
lack of dependency management tools, working with third-party libraries isn't a
nightmare anyway. The ecosystem is dynamic and moves slow (it's a good thing),
so upgrading libraries has always been easy despite the lack of official
tooling.

Here is a list of libraries I have been using in `deloominator`:

- [graphql-go](https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql)
- [mysql](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql) and [postgres](https://github.com/lib/pq)
  driver
- [goji](http://goji.io) for URL pattern matching
- [gorm](https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm)

They all have one thing in common: they are rock-solid and well-documented. It
sums up nicely how I feel about the entire ecosystem. I've rarely run into
libraries with missing documentation or strange behavior.

## The community

This is the sore point of my experience with Go. I've been thinking a lot about
how to approach the topic. The first strategy I came up with was to present a
(sadly long) list of examples of "culture that makes me uncomfortable". I
decided against it, because as a reader of that list, I'd feel the writer just
wanted to call people out. That is not my intention, I want to share how I
experience the community, so I will do that without sharing links.

I will start from the official GitHub [issues
tracker](https://github.com/golang/go/issues). To understand more about the
project, I read the [contribution
guide](https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html). It was depressing:

- No mention of any code of conduct. It makes me think a CoC isn't relevant enough
  for contributing to Go
- The only form of contribution mentioned is code. It makes me think the Go team
  only cares about code
- The review process must happen via gerrit, which makes me think the team cares
  about their comfort of review much more than about external contributions

I like [self-hoisting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting) languages, so
I moved on to issues anyway. But it has not been a better experience. I've often
felt people tried to be clever more than helpful, and I have seen incredible
resistance to change. I do understand changing a programming language is no easy
business, but in some cases it really felt unreasonable. What I'm trying to say
is that I do not feel welcome to ever open an issue, because I expect it
will be dismissed right away.

Outside of the official spaces, I've experienced a lot of contempt culture. I have
seen many examples of "X sucks, just use Go". This is not something I am able to
tolerate, so I do not feel engaged with the community. I've often seen contempt with
JavaScript, and it is not unusual to hear things like "I hope I never have to
touch JavaScript again". I have seen twitter threads using the "real language"
argument. People saying "X is not a real language compared to Go" or "Use Go,
that's a real language". These things do not foster a good culture, and miss on
great learning opportunities (we could learn a lot from npm/yarn, right?). On the
bright side, I had [this
conversation](https://twitter.com/lucapette/status/911931158396628992) on
twitter and I _really_ loved how
[NateTheFinch](https://twitter.com/NateTheFinch) handled it. Another great
example of positive attitude comes from a recent [twitter
thread](https://twitter.com/_rsc/status/921211286591098880) by
[_rsc](https://twitter.com/_rsc). We need  to see many more examples of this
attitude, especially from members of the core team. Because, you know,
"leading by example" has quite some truth in it.
