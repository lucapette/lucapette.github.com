It's high time I wrote this post. I've been thinking about it for a long time.
It was part of my first year *expat resolutions*. But of course I missed the
appointment with my first year. I was too busy enyoing my new life with
[@olia_la](http://twitter.com/olia_la), loving my new city, working with the
best team ever at SponsorPay.  Now, after another year, I feel ready to wrap
my mind around this experience, I feel ready to rant about my country, I feel
it's time to sum the whole thing up. Why would I want to do so? I don't know
the reason, but who needs reasons?

But let's start from the very beginning.

In April 2012 Olia and I rented an apartment for two weeks in Kreuzberg,
Berlin. We had absolutely no idea what to expect from the city. We came here
just to understand if we would like the city to the point of moving here.
Well, we did like Berlin. It was a whole new world compared to the place where
I come from. Basically, in Napoli (and mostly in Italy) we have good weather
and great food. Here it's almost the opposite. I say almost because the food
is not that bad, the weather is though, but I think it's not a big piece of
news. Our next step was renting another apartment for three months with the
goal of finding a good job for me. I applied for a few positions and I had a
very diversified experience. I got very bad offers (in terms of money), I got
very stupid interviews ("what's the result of `2^16`? what data structures do
you know?" I even got "what Ruby version are you using?") and then I found
this fantastic team at SponsorPay.  Smart people, nice numbers, interesting
organizational challenges and vibe, a culture for shipping code that I've
never seen anywhere else. It felt like living a dream.

But let's make a digression. I like digressions.

I need to step back for a second and explain how this blog post is being born
in my mind. Virtually, I started to write it when we moved here. I needed to
wrap things up, I dreamed about wrapping things up. It's a weaknees and since
we're at confessions I have a confession to make. I'm not writing
this down in one shot. I'm writing a small piece every few days. I want to
enjoy the process. I _earned_ this. I _earned_ this fetish way of placing
things in the right spot of my head. And what makes it funny in this process
is that my mood while writing this article is going to be very spiky. Now, for
example, I'm a bit drunk and I'm trying to conclude this weird day.

But let's go back to living a dream.

This may sound surprising but the moment my new life started shaping matches
the moment of my life I hated my country the most. It took me sometime to
decode this feeling. I'm a slow person, expecially with feelings. And I
needed my time. Then I got to a crucial point - the very reason why I felt
so angry at my country.  While I projected myself in the process of moving
somewhere else, I was sure I was going to miss some things badly. Well, it
didn't happen. I didn't happen at all. I missed the lack of missing things
from my country.  It's not the feeling I was prepared to digest. It was pretty
hard to decode why I was so angry at Italy. But think about it. I missed
nothing about Italy for a long time. Nothing at all. I'm not sure how to
express this but it was a disturbing feeling. I was waiting for the day I
would be missing something. I earned the right of missing things but it didn't
happen. Now, at the time of writing this, I'm not angry at my country
anymore. I just don't care. It sucks, I've turned into a white privileged
expat that doesn't give a shit about his country. It sucks because it wasn't
really a choice. It never felt like that. My country _forced_ me to hate
it. And you know what? I don't want even to rant about it. Fuck it. And fuck
my stupid goal of ranting about Italy.

It's hard to wrap two years up but it's a good exercise. I've read somewhere
that if you want to know where you are, you have to know where you came from.
It's probably true. And that's what I'm trying to do in the next sparse
sentences:

- I've left SponsorPay (now [Fyber)](http://fyber.com) after almost 2
  fantastic years. It was a love story basically. I liked the people more than
  I dislike advertising. And I really don't like
  [advertising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_F5GxCwizc).  As in all love
  stories, the end is bitter, but I feel I'm a much better programmer now and
  I feel lucky I've been given this opportunity.

- I've joined a new born company. Very exciting times ahead and a positive
  fear that I can get everything wrong.

- Olia changed her job already once - compared to three very hard
  Italian-style years, this is a great feeling.

- I feel hooked to Berlin. It feels like home, it even feels like a cage
  sometimes.  It's such a good fit for me that I'm afraid I would't be able to
  live anywhere else. It feels like Ruby in this sense. I hardly choose
  anything else than Ruby unless I can't use Ruby. Same for Berlin.

Now I guess it's time for some conclusions. But I'm going to disappoint you a
bit. I don't have much to conclude here. I've thought of being an expat for
years before becoming one. And it's very different from my expectations. This
confused me to the point I don't really know what's the point. I know that
these two years have been the best years ever. It may be not related to moving
away from Italy. But I can hardly imagine to find a SponsorPay team there.  I
have this constant feeling "it is Sunday morning" all the time. It's always
quiet around. There are almost no cars in the centre (yeah, German friends you
have no idea what a traffic jam really is), the public transportation is
awesome (again, German friends you have no idea...) and I can bike all the
time.

OK, I lied. I have a conclusion. I'm happy about what being an expat means for
me. And I found out that somehow I'll always feel myself an expat, even if I learn
German. It's a mixed feeling. Ah, that's the most important thing I've learned
as an expat: mixed feelings are hard to handle but their reward is unique.
