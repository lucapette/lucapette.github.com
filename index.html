  <h1 class="blog-title">Hello, people!</h1>
  <p class="lead blog-description">My name is Luca Pette and this is my website.</p>
</div>

<article>
  <p>I love sharing what I write and I use this website to publish my
  articles. I love writing about anything related to my interests.</p>

  <h2>Recent articles</h2>
  <p>
  <ul>
    {% for post in site.posts limit:5 %}
    <li><a href="{{post.url}}">{{post.title}}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>The <a href="/articles.html">articles</a> page organises my writing by
  topic.</p>

  <h2>Archive</h2>
  <p>The <a href="/archive.html">archive</a> page contains the list of all the
  articles I have ever published on this website. Some of my writing is old
  enough I probably disagree with myself by now. I consider it
  good sign.</p>
