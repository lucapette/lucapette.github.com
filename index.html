  <h1 class="blog-title">Hello, people!</h1>
  <p class="lead blog-description">My name is Luca Pette and this is my
  personal website.
</div>

<article>
  <p>I use this website to publish my writings. I dare to think they interest you.</p>

  <p>
  As I write about different topics, the <a href="/articles.html">articles</a> page presents my writing by
  category.
  </p>

  Recently, I wrote:

  <ul>
    <li><a href="/an-illiterate-guide-to-classical-music">An illiterate guide
      to classical music</a></li>
    <li><a href="/a-few-words-about-hiring">A few words about hiring</a></li>
    <li><a href="/some-notes-about-one-to-ones">Some notes about one to ones</a></li>
    <li><a href="/my-experience-with-kanban">My experience with Kanban</a></li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p> The <a href="/archive.html">archive</a> contains a list all the writings
  I have ever published on this website. Some of my writing is old enough I
  probably disagree with what I wrote.  </p>

  <p> Feel free to get in touch. <a href=mailto:lucapette@gmail.com>Email</a>
  is best.</p>
