A couple of weeks ago I had an interesting conversations with one of my team
members. She confessed to me that she felt slow. I was pretty surprised but before
moving on let me make a small premise: I hate the word performance. I'm not
sure how this word feels to native speakers or to people who didn't work for
Accenture. But to me, it sounds like "oh, the gigantic pile of bullshit coming
from the manager that has no clue, again." That's my usual reaction to the
word and I don't like to use it at all because of this reason. I must confess
I tried to find a better word for a long time and I ended up settling down for
programmers performances when it comes about measuring our job.

With this premise in mind, I told her I was surprised and then she asked me to
tell her more. And that conversation lead me to write this article. Our conversation
had two main topics:

- Watch an idea become reality in three steps.
- Forget the code, no one cares about that.

# Watch an idea become reality in three steps

I'm trying to figure out how programmers think and what are the steps that make
them write the code they write. Of course, this is going to be a complete
failure if you expect me to get it right and come up with a general solution.
There are so many other ways of looking at this that I don't even try to be
right, furthermore everyone has an opinion anyway. I'm just trying to abstract
a bit from the actual programming process to talk about speed and performance.
How are these two qualities reflected in the following programming steps?

1- Trying to figure out what to do
2- Writing the actual code that does that
3- Putting that code in production

1- Let's focus on the speed first. A programmer may be very sharp in understanding
what to do. She knows the system very well, she has enough context to ask 
product managers the right questions, she doesn't miss details and so on. This
generally takes time and I honestly haven't seen many people being fast at
this stage. And generally the speed here is deeply connected with
your own workflow. How involved are product managers at this point? Do you have
a checklist for it?
2- The second step is the one where I've seen most different results. Some
people are very fast at writing code, others are not. What matters here
is your review culture. Are programmers helping each other? Are
they moving code to staging environments before/after a review? How does the
review process work? I focus on those questions because, from what I've seen,
most programmers that are "really fast" write code that is not ready to go
anywhere. They miss the details, their code has a lot of "one time
workarounds", there are typical startup comments everywhere ("#TODO Fix
this").
3- Here comes the boring/painful stage. Given its qualities, it is
obvious we are talking about the most important one as only what comes out of 
this stage actually does something for your company, your product and your customers. 
Speed at this point is a mere consequence of the previous two stages. No actual work
needs to be done at this point in the ideal word. right? The job you've done
at step 1 made your code bug-free and perfectly complaint to the requirements;
the code you wrote at step 2 is perfect. Now, tell me: how many times have you seen
this happening? Code gets merged and you forget about it forever. I'm not
sure what your answer is. I'd say it's going to be close to "ehm... never!"
though.

From what I've seen in my career people have very different ways of dealing
with those steps. I met a lot of people that change the order (like in: let's
write the code who cares about the details of step one), people who
skip / don't understand / don't care about step 3. And here it gets interesting,
as most IT managers focus too much on one of the steps and so
do the programmers they manage. My opinion is: none of them count as long
as they're all there and the result is actually helping. It's important to understand
that what matters is the actual result. And most managers I've met don't get
they have to be patient. You have to wait for days to actually see the results.
Don't stop at "oh I love this programmer, she finishes stories in no
time". I suggest to be patient: look at her code one month later.
Wait for bugs to come up, wait for other programmers to have to change her code.
The bottomline: we focus on the wrong metrics and we have to pay more attention
to the entire process.

# Forget about the code, no one cares about it

I like to troll, that's why this section has this title. Of course,
as a technologist, I perfectly know the code matters, the language you use
influences the results, the frameworks you use will make your life easier next
year. But that doesn't change the fact that we (the programmers) are the only ones
caring about those topics and I'm fine with this. No one else cares. Your
customers don't. They expect the button to work and they want to do whatever they
please with your product. That's a point I never emphasize enough. We forget
the fundamental property your code has to have: it has to work. That's it.
That's hard to keep in mind when it comes to speed. The programmer that
generated this discussion forgot about this too when she felt slow. She told
me: "Oh, this guy opens pull requests all the time, that's super fast". Pull
requests don't go to production the way they're opened. And even if they do,
you'll have to fix the bugs that come out of that code. And this is a cost
that has an impact on your customers and on your _real_ speed.

I think this topic is strictly connected to what we decided to call "shipping
culture". I see two kind of attitudes about the shipping culture:

- people justify shit going to production in name of shipping culture.
- I see people spend hours getting blown away by the next hipster language
  features and how that will make them more productive.

Now, there must be a third way right? It's the one where I say I'm right and I
try to convince you to go my way. Well, sorry. I'm going to disappoint you a
bit. I think there isn't a third way. And I like that. I like that our job as
managers is to find a moving stable equilibrium between the two sides
of the spectrum.  The balance between "ship this shit" and "oh wait let's
make this perfect first" dictates your speed on the short and on the long run.
Focusing too much on the "ship this shit" will produce too much debt and
focusing too much on "let's make it perfect" won't produce enough. A few
paragraphs before I said we focus on the wrong metrics. And I really believe
so. The balance I'm talking about here means forgetting to measure
how many features a developer ships in a week or how fast she goes from starting
to work on a feature to opening a pull request. Writing the code is the fun part,
writing the code is the easy part. And no one cares but you about the code. I'm not
sure I can propose metrics that work better for your team, in the end metrics
are context-dependent. I can tell you I focus more on questions like "how
ready is the code I get from this developer?" "do we always have to review all
the lines?" "Are the features really bugged when they get on
staging/production?". Your mileage may vary and those questions may not apply,
all I'm trying to say is: focus on the value you add to your customers.

It is important to keep in mind that what we do is not writing code but adding a
feature on your website so your customers can enjoy your product more.
This attitude kills a lot of discussions around technology. It keeps
priorities focused on what matters for your company and your product. This
discussion plays a major role in "developers' speed".  I'm not looking at
their code, I'm looking at the features they write. And that's what I told to
the developer who felt slow. She might be kinda "slow" in the first two steps,
but we don't need to do almost anything in the third step. I like that, and while
explaining to her I feel she is pretty fast, I figured out I could share these
ideas. Other people may benefit and realise they are not as slow as
they think. Or better yet: they are not as fast as they think.
