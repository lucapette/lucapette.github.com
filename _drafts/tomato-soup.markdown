I invented this recipe after playing around with a few blog posts I found on
tomato soups. I like that it's neither too spicy nor too sweet, but both
charateristics are very present in the taste. It's easy to make (please let me
know if the instructions are not clear) and fast for a good soup. Perfect for
a winter evening. If you like wine, then a strong red is the perfect
companion.

## Ingredients

_Serves four_

- A spoonful of olive oil
- 1 garlic clove
- 2 big carrots
- 2 medium onions
- 4-5 large red tomatoes
- A spoonful of tomato paste
- 1 liter of vegetable broth
- A spoonful of Ras el hanout
- 1 small chili pepper
- Salt to taste
- Oregano to serve
- Estragon to serve
- 1 cup crème fraîche

## Tools

- A knife
- A chopping board
- A big pot
- A wooden spoon

## Instructions

- Finely chop the garlic and the onions
- Chop the carrots into small cubes, and halve the tomatoes
- Place the pot over medium heat and add the olive oil and the chili pepper
- Once the oil is hot, add the garlic and the onions, followed by the carrots
- After a few minutes, add the tomato paste and mix together until
  all the ingredients are coated with the paste
- Add the tomatoes
- Crush the tomatoes with a wooden spoon while they cook
- Add the broth
- As soon as the broth stats boiling, add the ras el hanout and salt to taste
- Turn the heat down to a simmer
- Cook until the soup reaches the density you like the most (I like it very
  dense)

## Serving

- Ladle the soup into a bowl
- Sprinkle with the oregano and estragon to taste
- Drop a tablespoon of creme fraiche into the centre

Enjoy it!

## Notes

If you don't have vegetable broth on hand, you can substitute with a bouillon
cube. The procedure is the same.
